# Surfs Up Analysis

This project consist of assessing how feasible is to open a "Surf and Shake" shop in Oahu, Hawaii taking into account precipitation and temperature records for a period of 10 years and taking into account the summer time (August) to year-end (December).

Based on historical data an analysis from data loaded in SQLite and analyzed with SQAlchemy, we can get information for the months fo August and December.

Results (please refer to images records):

1) Average Precipitation and temperature records:
June: 1700
December: 1517
Only a difference of roughly 1.3%

2) Mean temperature (F):
June: 23.8 
December: 21.67

3) Min temperature (F):
June: 17.7
December: 13.33

4) Max temperatures (F):
June: 85
December: 83

Summmary:

There is no significant change in the precipitation level.
As to temperature: one can expect a seasonal change but still it is not quite significant to deter tourism. Both surf and eating ice-cream can well be attractive to tourists, particularly from European countries were cold weather can be an issue.
